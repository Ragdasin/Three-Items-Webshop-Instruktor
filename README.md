and then the projects is the developed into three consecutive item cards.


After that, a shoppingcart is added to the main screen. Which is turned into a functional button with: NavigationView and NavigationLink

a CartView ui file is created so the application can switch between multiple pages.

And the "Add to cart" button is added functionality so it appends the item into an ArrayList of type String.
